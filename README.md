# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project delves into the exploratory analysis of credit card transaction data to uncover patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities. By examining various features and their distributions, we aim to identify distinguishing characteristics between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## 📁 Notebook

- [`Credit Card Fraud EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/GayatriKshirsagar/CreditCardFraudDetection/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20EDA.ipynb): Contains the complete exploratory data analysis process, including data preprocessing, visualization, and insights.

## 🎯 Objective

To perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on a real-world credit card transaction dataset, identifying key features and patterns that differentiate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions constituting a very small fraction of the total.
- **Feature Distributions**: Certain features exhibit distinct distributions when comparing fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Some features show strong correlations with the target variable, indicating their potential usefulness in predictive modeling.
